# hello-world
I want to build a Network Marketing System, whereby an enroller enroles 5 people, and each enrollee goes on to enrole 5 people each, and so on. Complete with admin dashboard and user dashboard.
My name is Mayokun Adeoti, a newbie programmer with tons and tons of tutorials and resources, but never written a line of code. Doing this hello-world assignment on github is my official baptism into codeland, and I believe that the many product ideas swarming around my medulla oblangata is bound to see the light of day.
Thanks
